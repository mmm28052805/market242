"# Germany Genome Editing Market 2025 First-rate Statistics Associated with Key Vendors- Horizon Discovery Group, Genscript,  Merck KGaA,  Lonza

<strong>Genome Editing Market Snapshot 2025-2033 provides a concise overview of market trends, forecasts, and growth opportunities over the forecast period:</strong>

Genome editing, or genome engineering is a type of genetic engineering in which DNA is inserted, deleted, modified or replaced in the genome of a living organism. In 2018, the common methods for such editing use engineered nucleases, or &#34;molecular scissors&#34;. These nucleases create site-specific double-strand breaks (DSBs) at desired locations in the genome. The induced double-strand breaks are repaired through nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR), resulting in targeted mutations.
