# Germany Ammonium Phosphate Market Fundamental Variables to Expand Growth and Development

<strong>Ammonium Phosphate Market Snapshot 2025-2033 provides a concise overview of market trends, forecasts, and growth opportunities over the forecast period:</strong>

Ammonium phosphate is the salt of ammonium and phosphate. It is a highly unstable compound with the formula (NH4)3PO4. Because of its instability, it is elusive and of no commercial value. A related &#34;double salt&#34;, (NH4)3PO4.(NH4)2HPO4 is also recognized but is too unstable for practical use. Both triammonium salts evolve ammonia. In contrast to the fragile nature of the triammonium salts, diammonium phosphate (NH4)2HPO4 is a valuable material, mainly as a fertilizer. Also of value is monoammonium salt (NH4)H2PO4 which is also valued as a fertilizer.
